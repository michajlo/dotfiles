# Trevor's dotfiles

These are my personal bash/vim settings. Fee free to use them.

## Prerequisites

You will need to install Homebrew first:

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)"

To get advanced bash tab completion:

    brew install bash-completion

There are some other tools you might want as well:

    brew install ack  # this is an alternative to grep that is very awesome
    brew install tmux # this is an alternative to screen that is very awesome

## Installation

Add these files to your home directory.

If you are using Windows, change the following files:

    move .vimrc _vimrc
    move .gvimrc _gvimrc
    move .vim vimfiles
